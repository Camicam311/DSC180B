These are derived from the Crm Cd Desc column since there are 141 unique values in the original column. Among the 141 values, some are the same, but with minor typos. Some others are just the same type of crime but with different severities. The Crime Type column classifies all the values into the five types of criminal offenses. These offenses are defined as the following[1]:\n",
    "* Personal - Crimes related to either physically or mentally harming another person.\n",
    "* Property - Crimes that involve the interference with property that belongs to another.\n",
    "* Inchoate - Crimes that were initiated but incomplete, as well as contribution to crimes.\n",
    "* Statutory - Crimes that are proscribed by law such as alcohol related crimes and traffic violations.\n",
    "* Financial/Other - These are white-collar crimes where one uses deception or fraud for financial reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the Crime Severity column indicates how severe a charge was and the resulted charge. With severity increasing from left to right, the possible values are: Infraction, Wobblette, Misdemeanor, Wobbler, and Felony. A fifth value, Others, is designated for extreme, rare crimes. An example is illustrated below of how *Theft* is classified into different severities.\n",
    "* Felony: Thefts of property over \\$950.01\n",
    "* Misdemeanor: Thefts of property under \\$950\n",

For *Officer 1 Division Number* and *Division Description 1*, there are no instances where both fields are empty. Thus, the method of imputation is to infer from the other column that is not null. Both columns indicate the same information, but are both kept because the division number is later used to compare with the division number that the reporting district falls in. Different division numbers imply that the officers do not usually patrol the area where the stop occurred. For such stops to be classified as the treatment group, the stopped area must also be an area that PredPol was deployed and the year must also align. For *Post Stop Activity Indicator*, there was a clear relationship between the column and *Officer 1 Serial Number*. The first step is filtering the stops data to show only stops made by officers who had null values in the indicator column. It was observed that all the non-null instances have a single unqiue value, N. Thus, the decision is to impute null values with N which means that no further activities were taken after a stop was made.
